== Welcome to PymePrivee

This is the result of ~48hours of hacking during link:http://alltogether.es 
to build something that can be helpful for small offline shops trying to jump
into the online business.

Because of the limited time and scope, it was intended as a very simple solution
and lot of hard decisions were made.

However, you can use the code freely, improve it, send patches, build a real
business on top of it. Whatever you like. Just include a link somewhere in
the product you build (the footer is perfectly ok) acknowledging that you built
on top of the hard work of 5 passionate hackers with a link back to 
link:http://alltogether.es

Thanks for reading this, and enjoy!
